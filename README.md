# Compression

Basic Implementation of LWZ and Huffman Compression Algorithms

Compresses the picture named "download.jpg".
And then deompresses it and stores it in a new file named "new_img.jpg".

Note: The "download.jpg" file should be in the same directory as of the file "lwz.py"/"huffman.py" and "new_img.jpg" file will also be saved in the same directory.

LWZ has an average compression ratio of 0.71
Huffman has an average compression ratio of 0.75

Lossless algorithms.
