# Compression

Basic Implementation of LWZ Algorithm

Compresses the picture named "download.jpg".
And then deompresses it and stores it in a new file named "new_img.jpg".

Note: The "download.jpg" file should be in the same directory as of the file "lwz.py" and "new_img.jpg" file will also be saved in the same directory.

Has a compression ratio of in range 0.55 - 0.7
with an average of 0.61

Lossless algorithm.
